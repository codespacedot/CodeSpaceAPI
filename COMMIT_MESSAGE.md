# Commit message guide

## Message Structure
```text
type: Subject
```

## Type
The type is contained within the title and can be one of these types:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Changes to documentation
- **style**: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc; no code change
- **refactor**: Refactoring production code
- **test**: Adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
- **chore**: Updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change

## Subject
Subjects should be no greater than 50 characters, should begin with a capital letter and do not end with a period.

Use an imperative tone to describe what a commit does, rather than what it did. For example, use change; not changed or changes.
